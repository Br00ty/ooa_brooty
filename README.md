# Oracle of Ages Tracker Pack for Poptracker

This is a Oracle of Ages map tracker package for Poptracker. This tracker supports both Janglers version of OoAR, and Drenn's version of OoA Cross-Items Randomizer. 

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases section, and then move it into `/poptracker/packs/` and you're all set!

## Tracker Info

This tracker does have support for Archipelago Autotracking, if Oracle of Ages were to ever make it to AP, we could easily set this tracker up for autotracking. I would love to get Autotracking working outside of Archipelago as well. Feel free to post any issues you find on Github, or ask any questions on the Oracles Speedrunning/Randomizer Discord!
