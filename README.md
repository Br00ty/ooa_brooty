# Oracle of Ages Tracker Pack for Poptracker

This is a Oracle of Ages map tracker package for Poptracker.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases section, and then move it into `/poptracker/packs/` and you're all set!

## Tracker Info

If a check shows up as `YELLOW` then that means the check is obtainable outside of logic.
Features include a Dungeon Shuffler Tracker and Full Dungeon Layouts for easy tracking.
This tracker does have support for Archipelago Autotracking, if Oracle of Ages were to ever make it to AP, we could easily set this tracker up for autotracking.
